# Push\_swap

This project is about sorting numbers with 2 stacks and only the following operations :
* `sa`	: Swap A -> Swap the 2 first element at the top of stack A. Do nothing if there is only one or no elements.
* `sb`	: Swap B -> Swap the 2 first element at the top of stack B. Do nothing if there is only one or no elements.
* `ss`	: Swap A and B at the same time.
* `pa`	: Push A -> Take the first element at the top of B and put it at the top of A. Do nothing if B is empty.
* `pb`	: Push B -> Take the first element at the top of A and put it at the top of B. Do nothing if A is empty.
* `ra`	: Rotate A -> Shift up all elements of stack A by 1. The first element becomes the last one.
* `rb`	: Rotate B -> Shift up all elements of stack B by 1. The first element becomes the last one.
* `rr`	: Rotate A and B at the same time.
* `rra` : Reverse Rotate A -> Shift down all elements of stack A by 1. The last element becomes the first one
* `rrb` : Reverse Rotate B -> Shift down all elements of stack B by 1. The last element becomes the first one
* `rrr` : Reverse Rotate A and B at the same time.

## Usage

To generate a set of instructions for a set of number :
```
./push_swap 1 2 3
```
or
```
./push_swap "1 2 3"
```

To check if the set of instructions sort correctly :
```
./push_swap 1 2 3 | ./checker 1 2 3
```

To create a set of random numbers :
```
ruby -e "puts (-50..50).to_a.shuffle.join(' ')"`
```
### Example :
```
ARG=`ruby -e "puts (-50..50).to_a.shuffle.join(' ')"` ; ./push_swap $ARG | ./checker -v $ARG
```
On fish :
```
set ARG (ruby -e "puts (-50..50).to_a.shuffle.join(' ')") ; ./push_swap $ARG | ./checker $ARG
```

### Compiling
To compile push_swap :
```
make all
```

To compile the checker :
```
make bonus
```

Start algo -> first find own way to do a algo -> then try maybe quicksort ->  then maybe trifusion -> etc...

functions to :
-read list ?
-compare element value and next (if > or <)
-push if element > next
-to check if a list is ascending
-to push b->a in ascending order in a, ascending part to ascending part
-to move lst to push in the right place

Do summary of all malloc variable to do a function to exit and free all in case of error ?
